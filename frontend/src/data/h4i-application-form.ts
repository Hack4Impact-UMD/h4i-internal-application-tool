Hack4Impact is a student-run 501(c)(3) dedicated to building software for social impact. We are the **University of Maryland, College Park chapter** of the national Hack4Impact organization. Each year, we partner with nonprofits to help them better serve their communities. We are recruiting software engineers, product managers, tech leads, UI designers, and sourcing team members for the fall semester.

**We are looking for new members who are:**
* Willing to commit their time for 1 semester (at least 5 hours per week)
* Excited about our mission and values
* Passionate about software, social impact, and our nonprofit partners
* Willing to learn

Extensive experience isn't necessary, but technical applicants should have programming experience. We place a strong emphasis on learning, so we’ll teach you everything you need to know beyond programming fundamentals during Bootcamp!

We have positions open for **Software Engineers, Product Managers (PMs), Tech Leads (TLs), UI/UX Designers and Public Relations & Outreach Team members**. 

**Descriptions for Open Roles**:

*Bootcamp*

Bootcamp essentially teaches members the necessary skillset to join a project team. In bootcamp, students learn web development skills starting from basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS and then building up to the FERN (Firebase, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The goal is for members to complete bootcamp and then join a project team the following semester. Similar to project teams, we are looking for motivated and committed students to join bootcamp and continue working with our nonprofit partners. The bootcamp workflow involves weekly meetings, doing the assignments during the week, and monthly chapter wide meetings. The time commitment is around 3-5 hours a week.

*Public Relations & Outreach (PR&O)* 

PR&O is Hack4Impact-UMD’s external-facing team, responsible for identifying and securing nonprofit partners, managing organizational communications, and maintaining the org’s public presence. The team includes **Outreach Coordinators**, who lead nonprofit outreach and project sourcing, with optional specialization tracks in finance or long-term growth. It also includes **Social Media Managers**, who create content across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. PR&O is a great fit for students interested in communication, business, social impact, or public policy, and there is no technical background required. The time commitment is around 3-5 hours per week.

*Project Teams*

Project teams work with real non-profit partners, creating solutions for any technical needs that our partners have. It's important to us when forming teams to find people who have the capacity to commit to the project for the whole semester. Otherwise, it's unfair to the teams and the partners. Our project teams practice the agile software development methodology, and project team members are expected to fulfil their commitments made during each sprint. Our workflow involves two week sprints, weekly meetings with your team, doing your own project tasks during the week, and monthly chapter wide meetings. The time commitment is around 5 hours a week.
* **Product Manager (PM)** - The Product Manager is responsible for drawing out the project roadmap, ensuring deadlines are met, meeting weekly with the team, nonprofit, tech leads, designers, and Director of Product to discuss project progression, staying organized in project management, being accountable for decisions, providing accurate updates, communicating professionally with the nonprofit, maintaining structure and effective communication within the team, promoting participation, encouraging interaction, and resolving conflicts effectively.

* **Designer** - The Designer is responsible for creating frontend designs based on nonprofit needs, attending team meetings and meetings with the nonprofit and PM, meeting with the Director of Design to discuss project progression, walking through designs for nonprofit feedback, collaborating with engineers to ensure design feasibility, meeting deadlines to support engineering timelines, and providing feedback on design implementation.
* **Tech Lead** - The Tech Lead serves as the point of contact for engineers regarding project technologies, researches and shapes the project’s technical direction, attends team and nonprofit meetings with the PM, meets weekly with the Director of Engineering, reviews pull requests, documents tasks on the Kanban board before sprint meetings, updates the PM on engineer progress and issues, and advises designers on the feasibility of their designs.
* **Engineer** - The Engineer is responsible for implementing all technological aspects of the product, attending team meetings, completing assigned tasks by the deadline, and updating the Tech Lead and PM with relevant issues.

**Why join?**
* Developing projects for our nonprofit partners as a student is incredible, and recruiters notice
* You’ll find a community of multidisciplinary, passionate people who love what they do
* You can learn more about a role you may want to have after school
* Attend workshops, tech talks, social events, and volunteer events
* Learn about working in the nonprofit sector and tech for social good
* Work with and learn more about some amazing organizations
* Get plugged into a strong network of accomplished and amazing alums

There are also PLENTY of opportunities to gain leadership experience. We have positions for mentors, a super fun board of directors, and even a national board and committees. As an organization and as a community, we care about and actively support the individual development of each member, both professional and personal. When you join Hack4Impact-UMD, you join a national network of leaders, techies, do-gooders, and friends.

Feel free to visit our chapter website at <https://umd.hack4impact.org/> or the national website at <https://hack4impact.org> for more information.

We will have rolling applications that consist of this written application and may include a live interview (not a technical interview). Those applying for the engineer and/or tech lead role are **REQUIRED** to complete a technical assessment (2-3 hours) included in the following sections of this application form. We will be CLOSING the form at **midnight (11:59pm EST) on August 19, 2025** or when openings are filled.

**Please do not use ChatGPT or other AI services to create or edit your responses.**

Please reach out to <umd@hack4impact.org> if you have any questions.

All admission decisions will be communicated to applicants no later than September 1, 2025.

**About Hack4Impact-UMD Teams & Structure**

At Hack4Impact-UMD, there are three types of teams: project teams, bootcamp, and the sourcing team. Project teams work directly with our nonprofit partners to create products to help the community; these teams consists of 🤝 Product Managers (PMs), 🤖 Tech Leads, 🎨 Designers, and ⚙️ Engineers. On the other hand, bootcamp is for students who are interested in Hack4Impact's mission but need experience before they join a project team. The sourcing team reaches out to non-profit organizations to secure projects for Hack4Impact-UMD. 

**🫂 Project Teams**

Project teams work with real non-profit partners, creating solutions for any technical needs that our partners have. It's important to us when forming teams to find people who have the capacity to commit to the project for the whole semester. Otherwise, it's unfair to the teams and the partners. Our project teams practice the agile software development methodology, and project team members are expected to fulfil their commitments made during each sprint. Our workflow involves two week sprints, weekly meetings with your team, doing your own project tasks during the week, and monthly chapter wide meetings. The time commitment is around 5 hours a week.

**🥾 Bootcamp**

Bootcamp essentially teaches members the necessary skillset to join a project team. Students will learn web development skills starting from basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and then build up to more complicated tools like Firebase, React, and Node.js. The goal is for members to complete bootcamp and then have the necessary skills to pass a technical assessment and join a project team the following semester. The bootcamp is mainly focused on developing technical skills, but there are opportunities to learn about other roles including Designer and Project Manager. Similar to project teams, we are looking for motivated and committed students to join bootcamp and continue working with our nonprofit partners. The bootcamp workflow involves weekly meetings, doing the assignments during the week, and monthly chapter wide meetings. The time commitment is around 3-7 hours a week.

**🗣️ Public Relations & Outreach Team**

Public Relations & Outreach (PR&O) is Hack4Impact-UMD’s external-facing team, responsible for identifying and securing nonprofit partners, managing organizational communications, and maintaining the org’s public presence. The team includes **📢 Outreach Coordinators**, who lead nonprofit outreach and project sourcing, with optional specialization tracks in finance or long-term growth. It also includes **📱 Social Media Managers**, who create content across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. PR&O is a great fit for students interested in communication, business, social impact, or public policy, and there is no technical background required. The time commitment is around 3-5 hours per week.

**Member Responsibilities**

Regardless of which team a Hack4Impact-UMD member is in, there are responsibilities that we expect all members to follow:

- attend mandatory general body meetings
- attend team, bootcamp, or sourcing meetings
- respond to Slack messages within 24 to 48 hours
- regularly check team Slack channel and #umd-general for announcements

There are additional responsibilities depending on the member's role and team.
